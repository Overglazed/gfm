# GoFundMe Donation Scraper

This little tool helps scrape the donations page and outputs to a csv in the terminal.

There are no public APIs for gofundme to my knowledge that can do this, so in order to work around this, the tool requires the cookie string from the HTTP request headers. This can be retrieved from development tools in various web browsers. 

I provide absolutely no warranty or support for this tool. All responsibility falls to the users. This tool simply exists for my own needs.
